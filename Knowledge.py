# Reading a File
# Computers use file systems to store and retrieve data. Each file is an individual container of related information. If you’ve ever saved a document, downloaded a song, or even sent an email you’ve created a file on some computer somewhere. Even script.py, the Python program you’re editing in the learning environment, is a file.

# So, how do we interact with files using Python? We’re going to learn how to read and write different kinds of files using code. Let’s say we had a file called real_cool_document.txt with these contents:

# real_cool_document.txt

# Wowsers!
# We could read that file like this:

# script.py

# with open('real_cool_document.txt') as cool_doc:
#   cool_contents = cool_doc.read()
# print(cool_contents)
# This opens a file object called cool_doc and creates a new indented block where you can read the contents of the opened file. We then read the contents of the file cool_doc using cool_doc.read() and save the resulting string into the variable cool_contents. Then we print cool_contents, which outputs the statement Wowsers!.

# Alternatively, one could write the code as follows.

# text_file = open('welcome.txt')
# text_data = text_file.read()
# print(text_data)
# text_file.close()

# Iterating Through Lines
# When we read a file, we might want to grab the whole document in a single string, like .read() would return. But what if we wanted to store each line in a variable? We can use the .readlines() function to read a text file line by line instead of having the whole thing. Suppose we have a file:

# keats_sonnet.txt

# To one who has been long in city pent,
# ’Tis very sweet to look into the fair
# And open face of heaven,—to breathe a prayer
# Full in the smile of the blue firmament.
# script.py

# with open('keats_sonnet.txt') as keats_sonnet:
#   for line in keats_sonnet.readlines():
#     print(line)
# The above script creates a temporary file object called keats_sonnet that points to the file keats_sonnet.txt. It then iterates over each line in the document and prints the entire file out.

# Reading a Line
# Sometimes you don’t want to iterate through a whole file. For that, there’s a different file method, .readline(), which will only read a single line at a time. If the entire document is read line by line in this way subsequent calls to .readline() will not throw an error but will start returning an empty string (""). Suppose we had this file:

# millay_sonnet.txt

# I shall forget you presently, my dear,
# So make the most of this, your little day,
# Your little month, your little half a year,
# Ere I forget, or die, or move away,
# script.py

# with open('millay_sonnet.txt') as sonnet_doc:
#   first_line = sonnet_doc.readline()
#   second_line = sonnet_doc.readline()
#   print(second_line)
# This script also creates a file object called sonnet_doc that points to the file millay_sonnet.txt. It then reads in the first line using sonnet_doc.readline() and saves that to the variable first_line. It then saves the second line (So make the most of this, your little day,) into the variable second_line and then prints it out.

# Writing a File
# Reading a file is all well and good, but what if we want to create a file of our own? With Python we can do just that. It turns out that our open() function that we’re using to open a file to read needs another argument to open a file to write to.

# script.py

# with open('generated_file.txt', 'w') as gen_file:
#   gen_file.write("What an incredible file!")
# Here we pass the argument 'w' to open() in order to indicate to open the file in write-mode. The default argument is 'r' and passing 'r' to open() opens the file in read-mode as we’ve been doing.

# This code creates a new file in the same folder as script.py and gives it the text What an incredible file!. It’s important to note that if there is already a file called generated_file.txt it will completely overwrite that file, erasing whatever its contents were before.
